# Welcome to Car Chooser

This data product chooses a range of cars based on the data entered by the user from R built in data set mtcars.

##Instructions

The user is required to enter:

* The required number of cylinders
* The maximum required displacement
* The maximum required horse power
* The required number of gears
* The type of transmission required
 
In a checkbox group the user may enter as many options as required but must enter at least **one** option. For the slider the value shown on the slider represents the **maximum** required value.

After entering the requirements the user should then press the *Select Car Models!* button. 

If any fields have been left empty the main panel will display the error message *Please enter more data choices*. Otherwise the application will display a range of car models that match the user's options. If no models match the options the message *Sorry there are zero matches for your data* will be displayed.
